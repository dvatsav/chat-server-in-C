This chat system is implemented using sockets. There is a server to which multiple clients connect. The server relays messages between clients. This uses TCP/IP sockets.
Multithreading has been used to handle each client individually. A shared memory has been initialized in order to store the currently available members. The socket writes to this shared memory while the clients may only read from this shared memory as the permissions have been specified as such. 

In each client, there are two threads, one two handle input from stdin and one from the socket. In each thread, polling has also been implemented to determine which of stdin and the socket are ready for input. 

For compiling the program, use make all in the terminal.
To remove binaries, use make clean

Testing of the program:
run the server program by typing ./server
open up some clients by typing ./client 127.0.0.1 4440
In each client, a user ID will be assigned. The user will be prompted to send a message with a list of available recepients.
Send 0 to send message to everyone, or else specify a specific user.
If an invalid user is selected, the user should see output "invalid user"
If an invalid port or ip is given, the user will be prompted with correct usage.
If an invalid format of users is given, the user will be told that an invalid format is given.

Errors: 
Invalid users selected
Invalid ports and IP addresses while connecting
Invalid user format given when selecting multiple people
